# Python MD4 Implementation

A lightweight and efficient implementation of the MD4 cryptographic hash function in Python. This repository provides an educational, Python-based implementation of MD4 for learning purposes, cryptographic research, or retrocompatibility with legacy systems.

## Features

- **Pure Python** implementation for portability.
- Follows the original MD4 algorithm specification.
- Includes test cases to validate functionality.

## Usage

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/timothyjxhn/MD4_Python.git
cd python-md4
```

Run the script:
```bash
python md4.py -h
```
